[Create your own XKCD-style Graphs]
===============================================================

A xkcd-style function plotter written in dart.

Forked from [this repo(written in javascript)](https://github.com/imkevinxu/xkcdgraphs/), which features graph creation UI by [Kevin Xu](https://github.com/imkevinxu) and [Charlie Guo](https://github.com/charlierguo), who also created a [website](http://xkcdgraphs.com/).
Original xkcd.js script created by [Dan Foreman-Mackey](http://dan.iel.fm/xkcd/), who created xkcd-style line interpolation roughly based on [jakevdp's xkcd-style-plots-in-matplotlib](https://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/10/07/xkcd-style-plots-in-matplotlib).
